                <h3>Blog Post One</h3>
                <small>Posted by Hamisi on April 18</small>
                <p>Avicii I remember me crying so many times just because I missed him and couldn't get to meet him ever. I remember breaking down badly because of it and wanting to change places with him just to show him how many people loved him and how many lives he has changed. I wanted him to know that he was my safe place through my whole childhood and through all the dark times. I wanted to get to know him and try to make him happier than he was. But I couldn't and now he's gone and I can't change anything</p>
